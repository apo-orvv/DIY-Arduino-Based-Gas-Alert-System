# DIY-Arduino-Based-Gas-Alert-System
This repository is for a gas detector system designed for detecting gas leaks. The system uses an analog gas sensor connected to pin A0 of the Arduino board. It includes LEDs for visual indication and a buzzer for audible alerts. Additionally, it provides appropriate status messages through the serial monitor.
